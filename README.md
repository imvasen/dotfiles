# Hector's dotfiles

Dotfiles are how you personalize your dev setup. These are mine. Feel free to
use them if they work for you.

This repo includes an installer for both MacOS and Linux. My preferred Shell is
ZSH, so that's what you're getting with this repo.

## Git

`git/*` includes some aliases and preferred configurations. For this config to
work properly `git-delta` & `vim` are required.

## Thanks

This repository was inspired by [Adam's dotfiles][adam-dotfiles]. I borrowed
some of the configs he had, made some tweaks to suit my preferences and I also
added some configs of my own. A significant portion of the code here is based on
his original project.
